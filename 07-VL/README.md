## Key Form Elements and Structure

### 1. `<form>` Element

- The `<form>` element is used to create an interactive form that can be submitted to a server.
- The `action` attribute is set to "post," indicating that the form data will be sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.

### 2. Text Input

- `<input type="text">` is employed for text input.
- The `username` attribute is incorrectly set; it should be `id="hey"` to link with the `<label>` correctly.
- The `placeholder` attribute provides a hint to users about the expected input.

### 3. Radio Buttons for Gender

- `<input type="radio">` is used to create radio buttons for gender selection.
- The `name` attribute groups radio buttons together, ensuring that only one can be selected.
- Each radio button has a corresponding `<label>` for better accessibility.
