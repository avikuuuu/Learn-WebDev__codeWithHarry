## Key Elements and Performance Considerations

### 1. `<img>` Element

The `<img>` element is utilized to display an image (`batman.png`). Setting attributes like `height` optimizes the image size for rendering. Efficient handling of images is essential for faster page loading.

### 2. `<table>` Element

#### Structure:
- `<caption>`: Provides a caption for the table.
- `<thead>`: Represents the table header.
- `<th>`: Defines a header cell in a table.
- `<tr>`: Represents a row in the table.
- `<td>`: Represents a cell in a table.

#### Performance Considerations:
- Proper use of `colspan` and `rowspan` reduces the complexity of the table structure.
- Tables should be used judiciously, as rendering complex tables can impact page load times.

### 3. `<ul>` Element

#### Attributes:
- `type="square"`: Specifies the type of the list item marker.

#### Performance Considerations:
- Lists contribute to a clean document structure but excessive nesting can impact readability.
- Consider the visual impact of list styles on page aesthetics.
